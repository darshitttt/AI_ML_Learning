# AI_ML_Learning

This repo is a collection of all the sample codes and notebooks to learn and understand the simpler concepts of ML and DL.
The course can be found on [Udemy: Python for ML Data Science Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-machine-learning-data-science-masterclass/).

The notebook contains my notes from the course, and some code that I was following along.
